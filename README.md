## Objectives
The objective was to design an interactive online quiz to demonstrate ability with HTML, CSS and Javasript. The Quiz should be intuative and offer a high level of interactivity.
I will create a multiple choice quiz which displays the sillouttes of a country and offer the user a choice of four answers. Points will be awarded for correct answers. To add interest, bonus points will be awarded for getting five correct consecutive answers. The player will have 20 turns to score as many questiona as they can.

## Scope
The quiz will focus on asking questions related to country sillouttes. This focus will help give it a strong identity with the objective of distingushing it from other quizzes.

## Structure
The quiz will be on a single page for simplicity. I will try and structure it to minimise scrolling. I will prioritise mobile design as I expect most users to use it to pass time while on the go. A silloutte of the country will be displayed to the user. Appropriately titled buttons will allow the user to interact with the quiz in an intuative and tactile way. I will use buttons as this will support users with touchscreens and prevent issues with people entring correct, but icorrectly spelled answers.

## Skeleton
Wireframe

## Surface
I will keep the appearence of the quiz simple, with bold colours. When the user answers a question I will provide feedback in with a green tick or a red cross to support intuative interaction.
